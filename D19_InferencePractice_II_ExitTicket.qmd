**Task:** When conducting hypothesis tests, we cannot be guaranteed to obtain a "correct" result, even when we do all of the mathematics, statistics, and interpretation correctly. Describe why this is so, and then respond to the following.

An occupational health team is evaluating whether workers at a battery recycling facility are being exposed to unsafe levels of lead. For the general adult population, the mean blood lead level is around 5 $\mu$g/dL.
OSHA guidelines recommend intervention if the mean blood lead level among workers exceeds 10 $\mu$g/dL. A random sample of workers from the facility is tested, and a statistical hypothesis test is conducted to assess whether the average blood lead level at the facility is higher than 8 $\mu$g/dL.

State the hypotheses for the test, identify what would be meant by a Type I (false-positive) error, and Type II (false-negative) error, and identify which is more concerning. How might this influence OSHA's pre-selection of a level of significance?
