## Reminders on Inference and Inferential Tools

. . . 

We use *statistical inference* to make or test claims about *population parameters* which we cannot measure directly

  + We ***make*** claims by constructing *confidence intervals*
  + We ***test*** claims by conducting *hypothesis tests*

. . . 

*Confidence intervals* provide a range of *plausible values* for a *population parameter*

. . .  

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{point}\\ \text{estimate}\end{array}\right) \pm \left(\begin{array}{c}\text{critical}\\ \text{value}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{standard}\\ \text{error}\end{array}\right)$$

. . .

*Hypothesis tests* provide a framework for testing claims about a *population parameter*, with major steps including...

## Additional Uncertainty with Means

. . . 

When doing inference, we utilize the *sampling distribution*

. . . 

With categorical data, our sampling distribution has a mean and standard error which depend only on a single parameter -- the population proportion(s) $p$/$p_1$/$p_2$

. . . 

For numerical data, the mean of the sampling distribution is the population mean $\mu$ and the standard error given by $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$

. . . 

With means, we have additional uncertainty associated with estimating the sampling distribution because we are approximating more population parameters via our sample data

. . . 

Because of this additional uncertainty, using the normal distribution is *too optimistic* and we use a "penalized" distribution instead

## The $t$-distributions

. . . 

The distribution we use to account for additional uncertainty is a $t$-distribution, from a family of distributions

. . . 

These distributions were first used by a brewmaster at Guinness who was trying to estimate alcohol content of beer using small samples

. . . 

These distributions have "heavier tails" than the normal distribution, reflecting greater variability when using a sample standard deviation $s$ to estimate the population standard deviation $\sigma$

. . . 

As sample size grows, the $t$-distribution becomes closer to the normal distribution, since more data provides a more stable estimate of $\sigma$

. . . 

Each $t$-distribution is characterized by its degrees of freedom ($\texttt{df}$), which typically equals $n - 1$ for a single sample

. . . 

This accounts for the number of observations in our sample that are free to vary after using one value to estimate the mean

## Calculating Probability

1. Find the probability of observing a value to the left of -1.96 on a $t$-distribution with 11 degrees of freedom.

## Hypothesis Test for a Population Mean

**Scenario:** A car manufacturer claims that the average annual repair cost for their new model is no more than \$400. To validate this claim, a consumer group gathers a sample of 30 car owners and finds an average annual repair cost of \$450 with a standard deviation of \$150.

## Hypothesis Test for a Difference in Population Means 

**Scenario:** Researchers are interested in understanding how social media usage varies between different educational stages. They surveyed a sample of 14 high school and 21 college students to measure the average time they spend on social media platforms daily. The average time spent for high school students was 2.8 hours per day with a standard deviation of 0.9 hours. For college students, the average was 3.5 hours per day with a standard deviation of 1.2 hours. Conduct a test at the 10% level of significance to determine whether this sample provides evidence to suggest that college students spend more time per day on social media than high school students.

## Hypothesis Test for a Difference in Population Means 

:::{.smaller}

**Scenario:** Researchers are interested in understanding how social media usage varies between different educational stages. They surveyed a sample of 14 high school and 21 college students to measure the average time they spend on social media platforms daily. The average time spent for high school students was 2.8 hours per day with a standard deviation of 0.9 hours. For college students, the average was 3.5 hours per day with a standard deviation of 1.2 hours. Conduct a test at the 10% level of significance to determine whether this sample provides evidence to suggest that college students spend more time per day on social media than high school students.

## Examples to Try

<br/>
<br/>

. . .

The following slides contain several examples to try

. . .

As usual, there are more than we'll be able to complete during this class meeting

. . . 

The examples include a mixture of scenarios involving a single population mean or comparison between two population means

. . . 

The examples also include a mixture of questions which are best answered with confidence intervals or best answered with hypothesis tests

. . . 

You'll need to determine which scenario you are in and which tools to apply

## Examples to Try: Daily Coffee Consumption

**Scenario:** A coffee company is interested in the average amount of coffee consumed by office workers per day. They survey a sample of 22 office workers to estimate this average and observe a mean consumption of 3.2 cups with a standard deviation of 1.1 cups. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the average number of cups of coffee consumed per day by office workers.

## Examples to Try: Average Sleep Time

**Scenario:** A university researcher investigates whether students in a demanding academic program sleep less on average than those in a less rigorous program. They survey two samples of students, including 45 from a very rigorous program and 50 from a less rigorous program. The average sleep time for students in the very rigorous program was 6.2 hours with a standard deviation of 1.3 hours. The students in the less rigorous program averaged 7.5 hours of sleep with a standard deviation of 1 hour. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in average sleep.


## Examples to Try: Bird Migration

**Scenario:** Ornithologists studying a specific species of migratory bird believe the average duration of one leg of their migration flight is about 6 hours. They observe a sample of 25 birds this season and find a mean flight duration of 5.5 hours with a standard deviation of 1.2 hours. Does this sample provide evidence to suggest that the duration differs from 6 hours?

## Examples to Try: Daily Step Counts

**Scenario:** A company has introduced a new wellness program aimed at increasing employeesâ€™ daily step count. Prior to the program, the average daily step count was 6,000 steps. After one month, a sample of 50 employees reports a mean step count of 6,400 steps with a standard deviation of 1,200 steps. Find a 90% confidence interval for the average daily step count after implementing this new wellness program.

## Examples to Try: Water Consumption

**Scenario:** Public health officials are examining differences in hydration habits between two cities. They survey 50 residents from each city to determine how much water they consume on average each day to promote health awareness initiatives. The mean water consumption in City A was 2.7 liters, with a standard deviation of 1.2 liters. The average water consumption in City B was 3.1 liters, with a standard deviation of 1.4 liters. Conduct a test to determine whether the sample provides evidence for a difference in average water consumption between the two cities.

## Examples to Try: Starting Salaries

**Scenario:** A career services office at a university wants to estimate the average starting salary of its recent graduates. They collect data from a sample of 34 graduates who landed jobs after graduation and found an average salary of \$52,000 with a standard deviation of \$8,000. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average starting salary of recent graduates.
