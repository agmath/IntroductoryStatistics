In this notebook, we'll work through several practice problems. The problems appear in no particular order, and each one is best addressed using a probability distribution/tool that we've encountered so far. As a reminder, we've seen

+ Discrete, counting-based probability  
+ The binomial distribution in the case where 
  + We repeat the same experiment $n$ times (we run $n$ trials)
  + Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure)
  + The probability of success does not change from one trial to the next (independence)
+ The Normal distribution for continuous variables which are, at least, *approximately* normally distributed 

We have the following useful functionality:

+ If $X$ is the number of successes observed in a *binomial experiment* with $n$ trials and probability of success equal to $p$, then

  + $\mathbb{P}\overbrace{\left[X = k\right]}^{\text{Exactly } k \text{ successes}} = \texttt{dbinom(k, n, p)}$
  + $\mathbb{P}\overbrace{\left[X \leq k\right]}^{\text{At most } k \text{ successes}} = \texttt{pbinom(k, n, p)}$
  + The *expected number* of successes is $\mathbb{E}\left[X\right] = np$
  + The *standard deviation* in number of successes is $\displaystyle{s_X = \sqrt{np\left(1 - p\right)}}$

+ If $X$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ (that is, if $X\sim N\left(\mu,~\sigma\right)$), then

  + $\mathbb{P}\left[X\leq k\right] = \texttt{pnorm(k, mean = }\mu\texttt{, sd = }\sigma\texttt{)}$
  + The cutoff value (quantile) $q$ such that the probability of observing a value at most $q$ is $p$ (that is, $\mathbb{P}\left[X\leq q\right] = p$) is given by $\texttt{qnorm(p, mean =}\mu\texttt{, sd = }\sigma\texttt{)}$
