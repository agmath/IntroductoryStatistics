## The `ames` Home Sales Data {.scrollable}

. . . 

The `ames` data set includes data on houses sold in Ames, IA between 2006 and 2010

. . . 

The dataset includes 82 features of 2,930 sold homes -- that is, the dataset includes 82 variables and 2,930 observations

. . . 

```{r}
ames %>%
  head() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

I've reduced the data set to only include the four neighborhoods where the most properties were sold

. . .

The reduced data is stored in `ames_small`, which still has 82 features but only 1,143 records

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

. . .

**Inferential Question:** Does the average selling price of a home vary by neighborhood in Ames, IA?

. . . 

Let's start by identifying how many distinct neighborhoods are in `ames_small`

. . .

```{r}
ames_small %>%
  count(Neighborhood) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) provides a method for comparing group means across three or more groups

The hypotheses for an ANOVA test are:

$$\begin{array}{lcl} H_0 & : & \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k~~\text{(All group means are equal)}\\ H_a & : & \text{At least one of the group means is different}\end{array}$$

:::

::::

## Intuition for ANOVA

. . . 

The main ideas behind ANOVA are somewhat simple...

i) Ignore the groups and calculate the variability from the overall mean
ii) Calculate the variability from the group means
iii) Calculate how much of the total variability is explained by differences between the group means ($\text{SS}_{\text{Total}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Between}} + \text{SS}_{\text{Within}}$)
iv) Standardize the variability measures by turning them into averages
v) Compare the average *between* group variability to the average *within* group variability

    + If the *between* and *within* group variability are similar, then there is no evidence that group means differ
    + If the *between* and *within* group variability differ, then that is evidence that the group means differ from one another

## Mechanics of ANOVA

. . . 

Here are the main steps in an ANOVA test

i) Calculate the overall mean ($\bar{x}$) of all the observed data, ignoring the groups.
ii) Compute the **total sum of squares** ($\text{SS}_{\text{Total}}$) to measure the overall variability in the data: $\text{SS}_\text{Total} = \sum (x - \bar{x})^2$
iii) For each group, calculate the mean ($\bar{x}_i$) and the **within-group sum of squares** $\left(\text{SS}_{\text{Within}}\right)$, which measures the variability within each group:  $\displaystyle{\text{SS}_\text{Within} = \sum_{\left(\text{groups, } i\right)} \sum_{\left(\text{observations, } x\right)} (x - \bar{x}_i)^2}$
iv) Subtract the within-group variability from the total variability to get the **between-group sum of squares** ($\text{SS}_{\text{Between}}$), which measures how much the group means differ: $\text{SS}_\text{Between} = \text{SS}_\text{Total} - \text{SS}_\text{Within}$
v) Compute the mean squares:
    + **Mean Square Between** ($\text{MS}_{\text{Between}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Between}} / \left(\text{num_groups} - 1\right)$)
    + **Mean Square Within** ($\text{MS}_{\text{Within}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Within}} / \left(\text{num_observations} - \text{num_groups}\right)$)
vi) The **F-statistic** is the ratio of these mean squares:  $\displaystyle{F = \frac{\text{MS}_\text{Between}}{\text{MS}_\text{Within}}}$

## Mechanics of ANOVA

:::{.nonincremental}

iv) Subtract the within-group variability from the total variability to get the **between-group sum of squares** ($\text{SS}_{\text{Between}}$), which measures how much the group means differ: $\text{SS}_\text{Between} = \text{SS}_\text{Total} - \text{SS}_\text{Within}$
v) Compute the mean squares:
    + **Mean Square Between** ($\text{MS}_{\text{Between}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Between}} / \left(\text{num_groups} - 1\right)$)
    + **Mean Square Within** ($\text{MS}_{\text{Within}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Within}} / \left(\text{num_observations} - \text{num_groups}\right)$)
vi) The **F-statistic** is the ratio of these mean squares:  $\displaystyle{F = \frac{\text{MS}_\text{Between}}{\text{MS}_\text{Within}}}$

:::

vii) Calculate the $p$-value using the $F$ distribution with `df1` as "one less than the number of groups" ($k - 1$) and `df2` as "the number of observations minus the number of groups" ($n - k$)
viii) Interpret the results of the test as usual (and in context)

. . . 

**In Practice:** The full ANOVA test will be run using software and we'll just need to interpret the results

## Completed Example: Home Sales by Neighborhood

. . . 

**Inferential Question:** Do selling prices of homes vary by neighborhood in Ames?

. . . 

$$\begin{array}{lcl} H_0 & : & \text{Average selling prices are the same across neighborhoods}\\ H_a & : & \text{At least one neighborhood has a difference average selling price}\end{array}$$

. . . 

Let's run the test:

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

ANOVA_results <- aov(price ~ Neighborhood, data = ames_small)
ANOVA_results %>%
  tidy()
```

```{r}
ANOVA_results <- aov(price ~ Neighborhood, data = ames_small)
ANOVA_results %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

**Result:** The $p$-value is very small (it's being rounded to 0 here). Since the $p$-value is less than $\alpha$ (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative to it.

. . . 

**Result in Context:** The average selling price of a home in Ames, IA does vary by neighborhood. At least one of the neighborhoods has a different average selling price than the others.

## A Note on ANOVA Results

. . . 

Notice that the result of the ANOVA test is simply that at least one neighborhood has a different average selling price

. . . 

We don't know which one, however

. . . 

We can identify which neighborhood(s) differ from one another by either (i) using Tukey's Honestly Significantly Different test, `TukeyHSD()` or (ii) using `inference()` to run the ANOVA test instead of `aov()`


## A Note on ANOVA Results

**To Use `TukeyHSD()`:** Run the ANOVA test as we did previously and then

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

TukeyHSD(ANOVA_results)
```

. . . 

It looks like the data provides evidence suggesting that all pairs of neighborhoods have average selling prices that differ, except for the Old Town and Edwards neighborhoods which *may* have the same average selling price

## A Note on ANOVA Results

**To Use `inference()`:** You won't use `aov()` at all; instead...

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

inference(y = price, x = Neighborhood, data = ames_small,
          statistic = "mean", type = "ht", method = "theoretical",
          show_eda_plot = FALSE, show_inf_plot = FALSE)
```

## What Still Remains of Inference?

```{r}
inf_df <- tibble(
  "Inference On..." = c("One Binary Categorical Variable",
                          "Association Between Two Binary Categorical Variables",
                          "One MultiClass Categorical Variable",
                          "Associations Between Two MultiClass Categorical Variables",
                          "One Numerical Variable",
                          "Association Between a Numerical Variable and a Binary Categorical Variable",
                          "Association Between a Numerical Variable and a MultiClass Categorical Variable",
                          "Association Between a Numerical Variable and a Single Other Numerical Variable",
                          "Association Between a Numerical Variable and Many Other Variables",
                          "Association Between a Categorical Variable and Many Other Variables"),
  '"Test" Name' = c("One Sample z", "Two Sample z", "Chi-Squared GOF", "Chi-Squared Independence", "One Sample t", "Two Sample t", "ANOVA", "?", "?", "âœ˜ (MAT434)")
)

inf_df %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

The only remaining inference tasks for us to explore are those involving associations between two numerical variables (*simple linear regression*) and involving associations between a numerical variable and multiple other variables (*multiple linear regression*)

## Aside: Linear Functions

. . . 

Perhaps you remember the equation of a straight line from algebra: $y = mx + b$

+ $y$ and $x$ are numeric variables, where $x$ is often called the *independent* variable and $y$ is called the *dependent* variable
+ $m$ is the **slope** of the line -- that is, the change in $y$ corresponding to a one-unit increase in $x$
+ $b$ is the **intercept** of the line -- that is, the value of $y$ when $x = 0$

. . . 

We can extend the notion of a linear function to include more than just one independent variable $x$

. . . 

If $x_1,~x_2,~\cdots,~x_k$ are all independent variables, then the equation $y = b + m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 + \cdots + m_k x_k$ is an extension of a linear function to multiple dimensions

+ $m_i$ is the **slope** with respect to $x_i$ -- that is, the change in $y$ corresponding to a one-unit increase in $x_i$ (holding all other $x_j$ constant)
+ $b$ is the **intercept** -- that is, the value of $y$ if $x_i = 0$ for all $i$


## Linear Regression

. . . 

In *simple linear regression*, we have a numeric outcome variable of interest ($y$) and a numeric predictor variable $x$ 

. . . 

Due to the random fluctuations in observed values of $y$ and $x$, a straight line will not pass through all of the observed $x,~y$-pairs but a straight line *may* capture the general trend between observed values of $x$ and corresponding observed values of $y$

. . . 

**Simple Linear Regression:** We can describe the relationship above by the equation $\mathbb{E}\left[y\right] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x$

+ $\beta_0$ is the **intercept** -- the *expected* value of $y$ when $x = 0$
+ $\beta_1$ is the **slope** -- the *expected* change in $y$ corresponding to a unit increase in $x$

. . . 

**Multiple Linear Regression:** We can extend the relationship above, accommodating multiple independent and numeric predictor variables$^{**}$, by the equation $\mathbb{E}\left[y\right] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k$

+ $\beta_0$ is the **intercept** -- the *expected* value of $y$ when $x_i = 0$ for all $i$
+ $\beta_1$ is the **slope** -- the *expected* change in $y$ corresponding to a unit increase in $x_i$, holding all other $x_j$ constant

## Completed Example: Simple Linear Regression

**Disclaimer:** There is much to learn about linear regression and we'll just scratch the surface here. The MAT300 (Regression Analysis) course spends over half a semester on linear regression models so check it out if you are interested!

**Inferential Question:** Is there evidence to suggest that the average selling price for a home in Ames, IA changed from one year to the next during the 2006 - 2010 time period?

:::

:::{.column width="40%"}

```{r}
ames %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Yr.Sold, y = price, group = Yr.Sold),
               alpha = 0.25, outliers = FALSE) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = Yr.Sold, y = price), 
              width = 0.25, height = 0,
              alpha = 0.15) +

    x = "Year Sold",
    y = "Selling Price ($)"
  )
```

:::

. . . 

Note that selling price (`price`) and year sold (`Yr.Sold`) are both numeric variables, so linear regression is the tool we'll need.

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

lr_mod <- lm(price ~ Yr.Sold, 
             data = ames)
lr_mod %>%

```

The `Yr.Sold` variable is statistically significant at the $\alpha = 0.10$ level of significance but not at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance.

. . . 

The fitted regression model suggests that: $\mathbb{E}\left[\text{price}\right] = 3904860 - 1854.81\cdot\text{Year}$

. . . 

Notice that this model is suggesting that selling prices of homes in Ames, IA got cheaper over the 2006 to 2010 time period -- likely a result of [the subprime mortgage crisis](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/subprime-mortgage-crisis).

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

. . . 

**Inferential Question:** Is there evidence to suggest that selling prices of homes in Ames, IA are associated with the living area (`area`), lot area (`Lot.Area`), lot frontage (`Lot.Frontage`), overall condition (`Overall.Cond`), year built (`Year.Built`), finished basement size (`BsmtFin.SF.1`), total rooms above ground (`TotRms.AbvGrd`), `Fireplaces`, `Garage.Area`, and the year sold (`Yr.Sold`)?

. . . 

In this scenario, we are making use of lots of predictors but linear regression is still the tool for us to use!

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Lot.Frontage + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + TotRms.AbvGrd + Yr.Sold + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

Notice that the $p$-values on several variables are higher than the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Lot.Frontage + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + TotRms.AbvGrd + Yr.Sold + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

The $p$-values on `Lot.Frontage`, `TotRms.AbvGrd`, and `Yr.Sold` indicate that these predictors are not statistically significant -- they are candidates for removal from the model

. . . 

We'll remove one predictor at a time, starting with `Lot.Frontage` since it has the largest $p$-value

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + TotRms.AbvGrd + Yr.Sold + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

`TotRms.AbvGrd` and `Yr.Sold` are still not statistically significant, we'll remove `Yr.Sold` this time since it has the highest $p$-value

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + TotRms.AbvGrd + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

Now we'll remove `TotRms.AbvGrd` since it is still not statistically significant

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

All of the remaining model terms are statistically significant, so we've arrived at our final model

## Completed Example: Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

mlr_mod <- lm(price ~ area + Lot.Area + Overall.Cond + Year.Built + BsmtFin.SF.1 + Fireplaces + Garage.Area, 
              data = ames)
mlr_mod %>%
  tidy() %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

The estimated model form is

. . . 

\begin{align} \mathbb{E}\left[\text{price}\right] = &-1800539 + 72.4\text{area} + 0.37\text{LotArea} + 8477\text{OverallCond} + 897.47\text{YrBuilt}~+\\ 
&~26.69\text{BsmtFinSF} + 12580.46\text{Fireplaces} + 69.98\text{GarageArea}
\end{align}

. . . 

There are lots of inferences we can draw from this model -- for example, holding all other predictors constant, each additional fireplace is associated with a higher selling price by about \$12,580.46

## Summary and Closing

. . . 

```{r}
inf_df <- tibble(
  "Inference On..." = c("One Binary Categorical Variable",
                          "Association Between Two Binary Categorical Variables",
                          "One MultiClass Categorical Variable",

)

inf_df %>%
  gt()
```

. . . 

We've covered lots of ground in this course -- you leave MAT241 with an ability to conduct statistical inference in many contexts

. . . 

There's still more to discover though, and I hope some of your will join me in future semesters to take MAT300 and MAT434
