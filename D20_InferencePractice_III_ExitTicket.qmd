**Task:** Describe the major differences between conducting inference on comparisons between two population parameters (ie. between two population means or two population proportions). Your response should address any procedural differences (is the "big picture" step-by-step process different?) and mechanical differences (what, if any, calculations must be handled differently?). You should also address differences in interpretations of results, particularly what a confidence interval or $p$-value refers to in each case.
