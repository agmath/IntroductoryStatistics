**Task:** In a routine screening program, the fasting blood glucose level (mg/dL) of adults without diagnosed diabetes is assumed to be approximately normally distributed with mean 95 mg/dL and standard deviation 12 mg/dL.

:::{.nonincremental}

1. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected individual without diabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 83 mg/dL and 107 mg/dL.
2. In your own words, explain what it means to say that "fasting blood glucose levels are *approximately normally distributed*.
3. Suppose that the true distribution is actually right-skewed, with a long upper-tail due to undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes. How might this impact the probability you calculated in part 1? Is this problematic?
